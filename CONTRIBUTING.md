# Contributing

I can't even fathom someone wanting to contribute to this project,
so if you're reading this with the intent to contribute; Thank you!
There's not a whole lot to ask of contributors, other than follow
the effective Go documentation and don't try to turn this project
into something bigger than it is.

## Development Workflow

### Go

Please follow the instructions outlined on the [golang][go-install] website.
Go is very opionated; if you're following the [effective go][effective-go]
documentation, there shouldn't be any issues contributing.

## Issues

If you have an issue, just be descriptive.
If you're fixing an issue, be sure it's scope is not beyond this project.

### Making Changes

Please make a pull request and be detailed on the changes you've made.
Remember to format your code with `go fmt`.
